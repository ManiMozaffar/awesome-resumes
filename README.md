- ### Six Second Impression
    The "Six Second Impression" is a concept in the recruiting industry that suggests that employers spend an average of six seconds scanning a candidate's resume before deciding whether to move forward with the application or reject it. This means that your resume needs to make a strong first impression and quickly communicate your qualifications and suitability for the job.
    
    To make the most of those six seconds, it's important to format your resume in a clear and concise manner, using bullet points and action verbs to highlight your achievements and skills. Use a readable font and keep the layout simple and easy to follow. Additionally, tailor your resume to the job you are applying for, highlighting the skills and experiences that are most relevant to the position.
    
    It's also important to remember that the six-second rule is not a hard and fast rule. While some employers may only glance at a resume for a few seconds before making a decision, others may take more time to carefully review each application. However, keeping the "Six Second Impression" in mind can help you create a resume that makes a strong initial impact and encourages employers to take a closer look at your qualifications.


- ### Purpose of Resume
    The purpose of a resume is to showcase your skills, experience, and qualifications to potential employers, with the goal of securing an interview and ultimately landing a job. A well-written resume should provide a clear and concise summary of your background and highlight your most relevant accomplishments and skills. It should also demonstrate how you can contribute to the company and solve their problems.
    
    In order to achieve this purpose, it's important to avoid using a generic or one-size-fits-all approach to writing your resume. Every job and every employer is different, so your resume should be customized to the specific job you are applying for. This means tailoring your resume to highlight the skills and experiences that are most relevant to the job, and using specific examples and achievements to demonstrate your qualifications.
    
    Using a generic or one-size-fits-all approach can make your resume appear unfocused and unprofessional, and may not effectively communicate your qualifications to potential employers. By taking the time to customize your resume for each job application, you can increase your chances of standing out from other candidates and securing an interview.


- ### Recruiters Requirements
    When writing a resume, it's important to keep in mind what recruiters are looking for. Recruiters are typically tasked with reviewing resumes and identifying candidates who have the skills and qualifications required for the job. They may also look for candidates who are a good cultural fit for the company and have a track record of success in similar roles.
    
    To meet these requirements, it's important to tailor your resume to the specific job you are applying for, highlighting the skills and experiences that are most relevant to the position. You should also include keywords and phrases from the job description in your resume, as many companies use automated screening systems that look for these keywords.


- ### ATS
    ATS stands for Applicant Tracking System, which is a software tool used by many companies to manage the recruitment process. The purpose of an ATS is to help recruiters and hiring managers organize and sort through large volumes of resumes quickly and efficiently.
    
    When you submit your resume to a company through an online application system, it is typically first reviewed by an ATS. The system scans your resume for specific keywords and phrases that match the requirements of the job, and ranks your resume based on how well it matches these criteria.
    
    To optimize your resume for ATS, it's important to use keywords and phrases that are relevant to the job you are applying for. These keywords should be included in your resume's summary, work experience, and skills sections. It's also important to use standard resume formatting, such as bullet points and clear section headings, as ATS systems may have difficulty reading unconventional formats.
    
    However, it's important to note that while optimizing your resume for ATS can be helpful, it's also important to create a resume that is clear, concise, and tailored to the specific job you are applying for. Ultimately, the goal of your resume is to demonstrate your skills and qualifications to potential employers, and to help you stand out from other candidates.


- ### Style
  There are several different styles of resumes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Here are some of the most common resume styles:
    - **1. Chronological**
      This style lists your work experience in reverse chronological order, starting with your most recent position. It is a traditional format that is easy to read and understand, but may not be ideal for candidates with gaps in their employment history or those who have changed careers.
    - **2. Functional**
      This style emphasizes your skills and achievements, rather than your work experience. It can be useful for candidates who are changing careers or have limited work experience, but may not be ideal for those with a strong work history.
    - **3. Combination**
      This style combines elements of the chronological and functional styles, highlighting both your skills and work experience. It can be a good choice for candidates with diverse experience or those who are looking to showcase specific achievements.
    - **4. Vertical**
      This style is becoming increasingly popular, particularly in industries such as design and technology. It features a single column of information that is organized in a clear and easy-to-read format. The vertical style can be particularly effective for candidates with strong visual skills or those who want to highlight their achievements in a clear and concise manner.
  
  Of these styles, the vertical resume with one column is often considered the best choice. It is a modern and visually appealing format that is easy to read and understand. The single column layout keeps the information organized and allows for clear section headings, making it easy for recruiters to quickly scan the resume for relevant information.
  
  Additionally, the vertical format is particularly effective for highlighting achievements and skills, as it allows for clear and concise bullet points. This style is also easy to customize and can be tailored to the specific requirements of the job, making it a versatile option for candidates in a range of industries.


- ### Target Role
    Defining your target role is an important step in crafting a successful resume. Your target role is the specific job or career path you are interested in pursuing. By identifying your target role, you can tailor your resume to highlight the skills, experience, and achievements that are most relevant to that position.
    
    To identify your target role, start by researching the job market and the industry you are interested in. Read job descriptions and requirements for the roles that interest you, paying attention to the specific skills and qualifications that employers are looking for. This will give you a better understanding of the key requirements for the role and the specific responsibilities you would be expected to handle.
    
    You can also learn more about the latest technology and trends in your target industry by reading industry publications and blogs, attending industry events and conferences, and networking with professionals in your field.
    
    When crafting your resume for your target role, be sure to highlight the skills and experience that are most relevant to the position. For example, if the job requires experience with a particular technology or software stack, make sure to include that in your resume. Be specific about your achievements and use quantifiable results wherever possible to demonstrate your impact and effectiveness.
    
    Finally, make sure to tailor your resume to the specific job you are applying for, rather than using a generic or one-size-fits-all approach. By customizing your resume to highlight the skills and experience that are most relevant to the job, you can increase your chances of catching the attention of recruiters and securing an interview.


- ### Snipe Advertisement
    Snipe advertising is a targeted approach to job hunting that involves identifying a specific job advertisement and company that you are interested in and then tailoring your application to match their needs. This involves researching the company and understanding their products, services, and technology stacks, as well as the requirements of the job.
    
    By sniping advertisements, you can focus your job search on companies that you are particularly interested in and that align with your career goals. This can also help you to stand out from other applicants, as you are able to tailor your application to the specific needs and requirements of the job.
    
    To snipe an advertisement effectively, it's important to take the time to study the company and their products, services, and technology stacks. This will help you to understand their business and the specific skills and experience they are looking for in a candidate. You can also customize your resume and cover letter to highlight your skills and experience in a way that is relevant to the job and the company.
    While sniping advertisements can be a time-consuming process, it can be an effective way to increase your chances of landing a job with your favorite company. By taking the time to understand the company's needs and customizing your application accordingly, you can demonstrate your enthusiasm for the job and your suitability as a candidate.
    
    If you have customized your resume and there's gap between your jobs, it's absolutely fine as the jobs are really related to the advertisement, and the HR still will check your linkedin if gap between jobs matters for them.


- ### Reach Back
    Reach back is a proactive approach to job searching that involves following up with recruiters or hiring managers after submitting an application. This can be especially useful if you have applied for a job and not heard back, or if you feel that your application may not have been considered due to factors such as ATS screening.
    
    By reaching back to the recruiter, you can demonstrate your interest in the job and your willingness to go the extra mile to secure the position. This can help you to stand out from other applicants and increase your chances of being considered for the job.
    
    When reaching back to a recruiter, it's important to be professional and courteous. You can start by thanking them for considering your application and expressing your enthusiasm for the job. You can also highlight any relevant skills or experience that you may not have included in your initial application.
    
    If your application has been rejected, you can also use reach back as an opportunity to ask for feedback and advice on how to improve your application for future job opportunities. This can help you to identify areas where you may need to focus on in order to strengthen your resume or cover letter.
    Overall, reach back can be a powerful tool for job seekers looking to stand out from the competition and increase their chances of landing a job. By being proactive and engaging with recruiters, you can demonstrate your interest and enthusiasm for the job and increase your chances of being considered for the position.


- ### Thanks Letter
    A thank you letter is a way of expressing gratitude towards someone for their help or support. It is a simple yet effective way of showing appreciation and acknowledging the efforts of others. Whether it is for a job interview, a recommendation, or any other situation, a well-written thank you letter can leave a lasting positive impression on the recipient.

    In the first paragraph of the letter, it is important to thank the person for their help or support and to express how much it means to you. In the second paragraph, you can elaborate on the impact their assistance has had on you and how it has made a difference. Finally, it is important to end the letter by expressing your gratitude once again and letting them know that their help will not be forgotten.
