## Why This Project Matters

**Scary fact:** Did you know that only 1 in 50 resumes get an interview? That's a 2% chance of getting an interview. This is why it's crucial to have a well-crafted resume that stands out from the rest.

In today’s competitive job market, a well-crafted resume is essential. It’s not just about listing your skills and experiences; how you present that information can make or break your chances of getting noticed. You can be a very senior person, with years of experience, but with a poorly self-presentation, you can be easily overlooked. Or you may be a junior/intern with a very well-crafted resume, and you can be easily noticed. This is why it's crucial to have a well-crafted resume.
