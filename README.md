# Common Mistakes

Even good resumes I see, have some common mistakes in themselves, so let's go over through 10 most common mistakes one by one, if your resume has even one of these big mistakes, then it means that this repository is gonna earn you many interviews!

**1. Complex langauge: Dont use langauges and words that are too hard to understand and follow**

- ❌ Executed a multitude of tasks pertaining to the optimization of manifold software paradigms.
- ✅ Improved software performance by 20%

**2. Buzz Words: Don't use buzz words too much in a way that seems not appropriate and normal**

- ❌ Leveraged agile methodologies in a cross-functional team to ideate scalable efficient solutions
- ✅ Leveraged Agile practices to improve team collaboration

**3. Many invalid metrics and statistics: Sometimes people rate their resumes with AI tools, which results in having many invalid numbers, remember in interview day you're responsible for all numbers and percentages that are inside your resume, so don't overdo this.**

- ❌ Increased code performance by 200% (without context or evidence)
- ✅ Optimized SQL queries by creating a caching layer, reducing load time by 50%, approved by A/B testing for the release candidate

**4. Unrelated achievements: The person who gonna hire you doesn't care in first place that what was your personal life achievement in most scenario, so make sure to keep your resume related to the job you're trying to apply for.**

- ❌ Increase sale and turn-over with ... business strategy (whatever, you're a developer! and your resume is for developer, not a business strategist/sale)
- ✅ Designed and implemented a caching solution that improved system latency

**5. Invalid technical statements: That's true! I've seen people saying they optimized their code by following clean code principles, which is not technically correct and possible, because that's just 2 different matters! So make sure that the statement and claim you have in your resume is technically correct**

- ❌ Optimized code by following clean code principles
- ✅ Refactored legacy code to improve readability and maintainability

**6. Be ATS Friendly: If your resume isn't ATS friendly, even if it's the best in world, it won't be even considered. Make sure you read the ATS section and apply the recommended solutions to your resume.**

- ❌ You're applying for "ReAct Frontend Position" but in your CV your title is "front-end" and React isn't mentioned.
- ✅ You know how ATS works, and you write your resume in a way to trigger ATS to be your mate, not your enemy.

**7. Bad Written Skills: make sure you read the skill section, I have seen people mentioning many skills that they actually don't have any idea about it. Wriitng your skill section carefully and nicely, will really increase the chance of getting interview and also getting the job offer!**

- For Python Backend Developer Postion:
- ❌ Expert in Java, C++, Python, Machine Learning, Maria DB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, FastAPI, Django, SQL, Spring Boot, Docker
- ✅ Python, Docker, Django, FastAPI, SQL

**8. About me is not a documentary film: I've seen poeple overdoing in About me section, or even in some cases TOO REGULAR about me, which is more likely to be 'ABOUT ANY PYTHON DEVELOPER' rather than about being you, so make sure you read the about me section if you don't have any idea how specific and what details you should write.**

**9. They didn't use bullet point! that's like resume-101, if your resume doesn't have bullet point then you're gonna be 99.99% rejected! make sure to go through the repository to see what does a good bullet point means**

- ❌ Writing paragraphs that make it hard to quickly identify key information

**10. Bad/Invalid Structure: Some people don't follow the general resume style and convention, which result in rejection. Make sure your resume is standard, just write it using a website resume creator! Some have been offered in bottom of repository.**

- ### Skills

  Hard skills are objective, quantifiable skills gained through training, school, or work experiences. Hard skills are often usually something that can be taught or learned. If you are a Software Engineer and you write code in Java, then Java is one of your hard skills.

  Soft skills are interpersonal abilities that allow people to communicate, collaborate, problem-solve, and navigate social situations. They are essential for building relationships, managing conflicts, and achieving success at work. Employers value soft skills as much as hard skills.

  Be very specific and careful with what you're writing in your Skills, most probably the interviewer will ask you many questions about the skills you have mentioned. Narrow your skills to your wanted Position, if the skill is unrelated, then emit it or mention it in one of your bullet points. For example, knowing PHP is not relevant for a Python AI position.

  When mentioning your skill, you have to support and prove that you have that skill through your resume with your bullet points, so make sure you've covered all your skills with at least 1 supportive sentence.

  Remember to never estimate your skill, unless you have a VALID certificate that proves it. A valid certificate is a one that you have gone through an exam for it, and it's widely accepted to be considered as a valid level, like AWS certificates.

  Remember to think twice about adding a skill to your resume, a bad example would be that you just know SQL syntax but you include PostgreSQL as your skill because you have installed it once. When you mention PostgreSQL, it means you can talk 15 minutes about it, saying what PotgreSQL is, and how it is different from other relational dbs, and AT LEAST some theory knowledge about features of PostgreSQL such as Materlized View, window functions, recursive CTE, special data types, and special Indexes. So be very specific and careful about what you mention as Skill.

- ### Six Second Impression

  The "Six Second Impression" is a concept in the recruiting industry that suggests that employers spend an average of six seconds scanning a candidate's resume before deciding whether to move forward with the application or reject it. This means that your resume needs to make a strong first impression and quickly communicate your qualifications and suitability for the job.

  To make the most of those six seconds, it's important to format your resume in a clear and concise manner, using bullet points and action verbs to highlight your achievements and skills. Use a readable font and keep the layout simple and easy to follow. Additionally, tailor your resume to the job you are applying for, highlighting the skills and experiences that are most relevant to the position.

  It's also important to remember that the six-second rule is not a hard and fast rule. While some employers may only glance at a resume for a few seconds before making a decision, others may take more time to carefully review each application. However, keeping the "Six Second Impression" in mind can help you create a resume that makes a strong initial impact and encourages employers to take a closer look at your qualifications.

- ### Purpose of Resume

  The purpose of a resume is to showcase your skills, experience, and qualifications to potential employers, with the goal of securing an interview and ultimately landing a job. A well-written resume should provide a clear and concise summary of your background and highlight your most relevant accomplishments and skills. It should also demonstrate how you can contribute to the company and solve their problems.

  In order to achieve this purpose, it's important to avoid using a generic or one-size-fits-all approach to writing your resume. Every job and every employer is different, so your resume should be customized to the specific job you are applying for. This means tailoring your resume to highlight the skills and experiences that are most relevant to the job, and using specific examples and achievements to demonstrate your qualifications.

  Using a generic or one-size-fits-all approach can make your resume appear unfocused and unprofessional, and may not effectively communicate your qualifications to potential employers. By taking the time to customize your resume for each job application, you can increase your chances of standing out from other candidates and securing an interview.

- ### Recruiters Requirements

  When writing a resume, it's important to keep in mind what recruiters are looking for. Recruiters are typically tasked with reviewing resumes and identifying candidates who have the skills and qualifications required for the job. They may also look for candidates who are a good cultural fit for the company and have a track record of success in similar roles.

  To meet these requirements, it's important to tailor your resume to the specific job you are applying for, highlighting the skills and experiences that are most relevant to the position. You should also include keywords and phrases from the job description in your resume, as many companies use automated screening systems that look for these keywords.

- ### ATS

  ATS stands for Applicant Tracking System, which is a software tool used by many companies to manage the recruitment process. The purpose of an ATS is to help recruiters and hiring managers organize and sort through large volumes of resumes quickly and efficiently.

  When you submit your resume to a company through an online application system, it is typically first reviewed by an ATS. The system scans your resume for specific keywords and phrases that match the requirements of the job, and ranks your resume based on how well it matches these criteria.

  To optimize your resume for ATS, it's important to use keywords and phrases that are relevant to the job you are applying for. These keywords should be included in your resume's summary, work experience, and skills sections. It's also important to use standard resume formatting, such as bullet points and clear section headings, as ATS systems may have difficulty reading unconventional formats.

  You should write your resume in a way that is friendly to ATS, not an enemy, Some tips for that
  - ATS system may be case sensitive and stupid, so if the job title is "frontend", then write "frontend", not "front-end" or "FrontEnd" or "front end".
  - There are keywords and structure that you MUST have in your resume, like bullet points and clear section headings and etc. Make sure you have them all.
  - You've to match your resume versus the description, make sure the exact words in the description is also matched in your resume. You can even consider writing a script yourself to see how many % it match. Just don't overdo it in a way to copy paste the advertisement in your resume haha
  - The resume has written "React.js", but you have written "Re-act", which simply may result in your rejection. Remember to consider ATS as a very dumb person.
  - Make sure your sections and document can be recogznied by ATS, you can try uploading your resume in few website ATS to see if they could detect the text inside your resume or not. They may not in a conditions such as weird font, bad styling and etc.

- ### Style

  There are several different styles of resumes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Here are some of the most common resume styles:

  - **1. Chronological**
    This style lists your work experience in reverse chronological order, starting with your most recent position. It is a traditional format that is easy to read and understand, but may not be ideal for candidates with gaps in their employment history or those who have changed careers.
  - **2. Functional**
    This style emphasizes your skills and achievements, rather than your work experience. It can be useful for candidates who are changing careers or have limited work experience, but may not be ideal for those with a strong work history.
  - **3. Combination**
    This style combines elements of the chronological and functional styles, highlighting both your skills and work experience. It can be a good choice for candidates with diverse experience or those who are looking to showcase specific achievements.
  - **4. Vertical**
    This style is becoming increasingly popular, particularly in industries such as design and technology. It features a single column of information that is organized in a clear and easy-to-read format. The vertical style can be particularly effective for candidates with strong visual skills or those who want to highlight their achievements in a clear and concise manner.

  Of these styles, the vertical resume with one column is often considered the best choice. It is a modern and visually appealing format that is easy to read and understand. The single column layout keeps the information organized and allows for clear section headings, making it easy for recruiters to quickly scan the resume for relevant information.

  Additionally, the vertical format is particularly effective for highlighting achievements and skills, as it allows for clear and concise bullet points. This style is also easy to customize and can be tailored to the specific requirements of the job, making it a versatile option for candidates in a range of industries.

- ### Target Role

  Defining your target role is an important step in crafting a successful resume. Your target role is the specific job or career path you are interested in pursuing. By identifying your target role, you can tailor your resume to highlight the skills, experience, and achievements that are most relevant to that position.

  To identify your target role, start by researching the job market and the industry you are interested in. Read job descriptions and requirements for the roles that interest you, paying attention to the specific skills and qualifications that employers are looking for. This will give you a better understanding of the key requirements for the role and the specific responsibilities you would be expected to handle.

  You can also learn more about the latest technology and trends in your target industry by reading industry publications and blogs, attending industry events and conferences, and networking with professionals in your field.

  When crafting your resume for your target role, be sure to highlight the skills and experience that are most relevant to the position. For example, if the job requires experience with a particular technology or software stack, make sure to include that in your resume. Be specific about your achievements and use quantifiable results wherever possible to demonstrate your impact and effectiveness.

  Finally, make sure to tailor your resume to the specific job you are applying for, rather than using a generic or one-size-fits-all approach. By customizing your resume to highlight the skills and experience that are most relevant to the job, you can increase your chances of catching the attention of recruiters and securing an interview.

- ### Snipe Advertisement

  Snipe advertising is a targeted approach to job hunting that involves identifying a specific job advertisement and company that you are interested in and then tailoring your application to match their needs. This involves researching the company and understanding their products, services, and technology stacks, as well as the requirements of the job.

  By sniping advertisements, you can focus your job search on companies that you are particularly interested in and that align with your career goals. This can also help you to stand out from other applicants, as you are able to tailor your application to the specific needs and requirements of the job.

  To snipe an advertisement effectively, it's important to take the time to study the company and their products, services, and technology stacks. This will help you to understand their business and the specific skills and experience they are looking for in a candidate. You can also customize your resume and cover letter to highlight your skills and experience in a way that is relevant to the job and the company.
  While sniping advertisements can be a time-consuming process, it can be an effective way to increase your chances of landing a job with your favorite company. By taking the time to understand the company's needs and customizing your application accordingly, you can demonstrate your enthusiasm for the job and your suitability as a candidate.

  If you have customized your resume and there's gap between your jobs, it's absolutely fine as the jobs are really related to the advertisement, and the HR still will check your linkedin if gap between jobs matters for them.

- ### Reach Back

  Reach back is a proactive approach to job searching that involves following up with recruiters or hiring managers after submitting an application. This can be especially useful if you have applied for a job and not heard back, or if you feel that your application may not have been considered due to factors such as ATS screening.

  By reaching back to the recruiter, you can demonstrate your interest in the job and your willingness to go the extra mile to secure the position. This can help you to stand out from other applicants and increase your chances of being considered for the job.

  When reaching back to a recruiter, it's important to be professional and courteous. You can start by thanking them for considering your application and expressing your enthusiasm for the job. You can also highlight any relevant skills or experience that you may not have included in your initial application.

  If your application has been rejected, you can also use reach back as an opportunity to ask for feedback and advice on how to improve your application for future job opportunities. This can help you to identify areas where you may need to focus on in order to strengthen your resume or cover letter.
  Overall, reach back can be a powerful tool for job seekers looking to stand out from the competition and increase their chances of landing a job. By being proactive and engaging with recruiters, you can demonstrate your interest and enthusiasm for the job and increase your chances of being considered for the position.

- ### Thanks Letter

  A thank you letter is a way of expressing gratitude towards someone for their help or support. It is a simple yet effective way of showing appreciation and acknowledging the efforts of others. Whether it is for a job interview, a recommendation, or any other situation, a well-written thank you letter can leave a lasting positive impression on the recipient.

  In the first paragraph of the letter, it is important to thank the person for their help or support and to express how much it means to you. In the second paragraph, you can elaborate on the impact their assistance has had on you and how it has made a difference. Finally, it is important to end the letter by expressing your gratitude once again and letting them know that their help will not be forgotten.
