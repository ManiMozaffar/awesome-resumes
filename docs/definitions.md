## HR

**HR**: Human Resources. The department responsible for hiring and managing employees. HR staff often screen resumes before passing them on to the hiring manager.

## Six Second Impression

**Six Second Impression**: Recruiters often spend just six seconds scanning a resume, so it needs to be clear, concise, and easy to read. Use bullet points, action verbs, and a simple layout to highlight your key skills and achievements quickly. Tailor your resume to the job to make those seconds count.

## ATS (Applicant Tracking System)

An **Applicant Tracking System (ATS)** is software that filters resumes based on keywords before a human ever sees them. To beat the ATS, use relevant keywords from the job description and avoid fancy formatting that might mess with the software.

## Action Verbs

**Action Verbs** are strong, dynamic words that describe your accomplishments, like "led," "designed," or "managed." They make your experience sound more impactful.

## Tailoring

**Tailoring** your resume means customizing it for each job by emphasizing the skills and experiences that match the specific role. It’s how you make your resume stand out to both the ATS and the human recruiter.

## Resume Sections

### Personal Information

This is the basic stuff. Name, phone number, email, LinkedIn profile, and maybe a GitHub link if you’re a techie. Keep it simple and easy to find.

### Summary

This is your elevator pitch. A quick snapshot of who you are, what you do, and what you bring to the table. Should be short, punchy, and make someone want to keep reading.

### Skills

List your main skills here. Hard skills like programming languages, tools, and technologies. Soft skills like teamwork or leadership go here too, but keep the focus on what’s relevant for the job.

### Work Experience

This is where you show off what you’ve done. List your past jobs, starting with the most recent. Focus on what you achieved, not just what you did. Use bullet points for easy reading.

### Education

Where you studied and what you studied. Include your degree(s), school name, and graduation date. If you’re still studying, mention your expected graduation date.

### Projects

Highlight some cool stuff you’ve worked on outside of your main job. Side projects, open-source contributions, anything that shows your passion and initiative. Keep it relevant to the job you’re applying for.

### References

Some people like to add this, but honestly, "References available upon request" is fine. Don’t waste space unless you know they’ll ask for it upfront.

### Certifications & Trainings

Show off any extra qualifications you have. Online courses, certifications, workshops—anything that adds value and shows you’re committed to growing your skills.

### Publications & Conferences

If you’ve written articles, papers, or spoken at conferences, mention them here. It’s not for everyone, but if it’s relevant, flaunt it.

### Volunteer Experience

If you’ve done some meaningful volunteer work, especially in a leadership role or in a field related to your job, put it here. It’s great for showing you’re well-rounded and community-minded.

### Awards

Brag about any awards or recognitions you’ve received. Keep it relevant and recent, though. Nobody cares about that spelling bee you won in third grade.

### Courses

If you’ve taken any courses that are relevant but not part of your main degree, list them here. It shows you’re always learning and improving.

### Memberships

If you’re part of any professional organizations or clubs, put them here. It can help you stand out, especially if they’re well-regarded in your field.

### Trainings

Kind of like the Certifications section, but more focused on professional development you’ve done on the job. Include workshops, in-house training, or seminars.

### Languages

List any languages you speak fluently. This can be a big plus if the job involves international work or if the company has a diverse team.
