### Reach Back

Reach back is a proactive approach to job searching that involves following up with recruiters or hiring managers after submitting an application. This can be especially useful if you have applied for a job and not heard back, or if you feel that your application may not have been considered due to factors such as ATS screening.

By reaching back to the recruiter, you can demonstrate your interest in the job and your willingness to go the extra mile to secure the position. This can help you to stand out from other applicants and increase your chances of being considered for the job.

When reaching back to a recruiter, it's important to be professional and courteous. You can start by thanking them for considering your application and expressing your enthusiasm for the job. You can also highlight any relevant skills or experience that you may not have included in your initial application.

If your application has been rejected, you can also use reach back as an opportunity to ask for feedback and advice on how to improve your application for future job opportunities. This can help you to identify areas where you may need to focus on in order to strengthen your resume or cover letter.
Overall, reach back can be a powerful tool for job seekers looking to stand out from the competition and increase their chances of landing a job. By being proactive and engaging with recruiters, you can demonstrate your interest and enthusiasm for the job and increase your chances of being considered for the position.

### Thanks Letter

A thank you letter is a way of expressing gratitude towards someone for their help or support. It is a simple yet effective way of showing appreciation and acknowledging the efforts of others. Whether it is for a job interview, a recommendation, or any other situation, a well-written thank you letter can leave a lasting positive impression on the recipient.

In the first paragraph of the letter, it is important to thank the person for their help or support and to express how much it means to you. In the second paragraph, you can elaborate on the impact their assistance has had on you and how it has made a difference. Finally, it is important to end the letter by expressing your gratitude once again and letting them know that their help will not be forgotten.
