# ATS

ATS stands for Applicant Tracking System, which is a software tool used by many companies to manage the recruitment process. The purpose of an ATS is to help recruiters and hiring managers organize and sort through large volumes of resumes quickly and efficiently.

When you submit your resume to a company through an online application system, it is typically first reviewed by an ATS. The system scans your resume for specific keywords and phrases that match the requirements of the job and ranks your resume based on how well it matches these criteria.

To optimize your resume for ATS, it's important to use keywords and phrases that are relevant to the job you are applying for. These keywords should be included in your resume's summary, work experience, and skills sections. It's also important to use standard resume formatting, such as bullet points and clear section headings, as ATS systems may have difficulty reading unconventional formats.

You should write your resume in a way that is friendly to ATS, not an enemy, Some tips for that

- ATS system may be case sensitive and stupid, so if the job title is "frontend", then write "frontend", not "front-end" or "FrontEnd" or "front end".
- There are keywords and structure that you MUST have in your resume, like bullet points and clear section headings, etc. Make sure you have them all.
- You've to match your resume versus the description, make sure the exact words in the description are also matched in your resume. You can even consider writing a script yourself to see how many % it matches. Just don't overdo it in a way to copy-paste the advertisement into your resume haha
- The resume has written "React.js", but you have written "Re-act", which simply may result in your rejection. Remember to consider ATS as a very dumb person.
- Make sure your sections and documents can be recognized by ATS, you can try uploading your resume to a few websites ATS to see if they can detect the text inside your resume or not. They may not be in conditions such as weird font, bad styling, etc.
