# The Shotgun Approach to Job Seeking: Why It's a Bad Idea

## What is the Shotgun Approach?

The **shotgun approach** in job hunting is all about quantity over quality. You blast out your resume to as many job openings as possible, hoping that something sticks. The idea is that the more applications you send out, the higher your chances of landing a job. Sounds logical, right? Well, not really.

## Why the Shotgun Approach Fails

The shotgun approach might feel productive because you’re applying to tons of jobs, but it usually backfires. Here’s why:

1. **Generic Applications Get Ignored**: Hiring managers can spot a generic resume from a mile away. If your application isn’t tailored to the specific job, it’s likely to end up in the trash. Companies want to see that you’re genuinely interested in _their_ role, not just any role.

2. **Wasted Effort**: Sending out 100 applications with little to no results is demoralizing. Instead of spreading yourself thin, focus on fewer applications with more effort put into each.

3. **You Lose Focus**: When you apply for anything and everything, you come across as unsure about what you want. Employers are looking for candidates who know what they’re after.

## A Better Alternative: The Targeted Approach

Rather than spraying your resume everywhere, try the **targeted approach**:

1. **Quality Over Quantity**: Focus on roles that truly match your skills and interests. Spend time tailoring your resume and cover letter for each application. Make it clear why you’re a perfect fit for _that_ job.

2. **Research and Network**: Learn about the companies you’re applying to. If possible, connect with current employees or reach out to the hiring manager. This extra effort shows dedication and can set you apart.

3. **Highlight Relevant Skills**: Customize your resume to highlight the skills and experiences that are most relevant to the job. This makes it easier for recruiters to see why you’re a strong candidate.

!!! tip "Use a Spreadsheet when targeting jobs"

    Keep track of the jobs you apply to, including the company name, job title, date applied, and any other relevant details. This will help you stay organized and follow up effectively.

!!! tip "Key to success is to understand the job requirements"

    The key to a successful job application is understanding the job requirements and tailoring your resume to match them. Highlight the skills and experiences that are most relevant to the role, and show how you can add value to the company. Try to put yourself in the shoes of the hiring manager and think about what they are looking for in a candidate. This will help you create a resume that stands out and gets noticed.
    Additionally, I recommend to research about company's product, stack, and culture. This can help you to understand the company better and tailor your resume to match their needs.

## Final Thoughts

Applying to fewer jobs with more focus and customization is a much more effective strategy than the shotgun approach. It may take more time, but the chances of landing an interview—and ultimately a job—are much higher. Remember, it’s not about applying to every job out there; it’s about applying to the right jobs with the right application.

Invest your time wisely, and you’ll find the results much more satisfying.
