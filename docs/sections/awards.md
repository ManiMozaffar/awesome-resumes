# How to List Awards on Your Resume

## Why Awards Matter

Including awards on your resume is a great way to highlight your accomplishments and stand out from other candidates. They show that you’ve been recognized for your hard work and excellence, whether in academics, professional settings, or other achievements. However, it’s essential to be selective and strategic about which awards to include and how you present them.

## Where to List Awards

- **Education Section:** Include academic awards like scholarships, Dean’s List, or honors within your education section. This is especially relevant if you’re early in your career or applying for roles that value academic achievement.
- **Work Experience Section:** If you’ve received awards related to your job performance, list them within the work experience section under the relevant job. This helps to contextualize your achievements.
- **Dedicated Awards Section:** If you have multiple awards or particularly prestigious ones, create a separate “Awards” or “Honors” section. This can draw more attention to your accomplishments.

## How to Format Awards

Each award listing should include:

- **Name of the Award:** Clearly state the name of the award.
- **Date Received:** Include the month and year you received the award.
- **Awarding Body:** Mention the organization or institution that granted the award.
- **Reason or Achievement:** Briefly explain why you received the award, especially if it’s not self-explanatory. For example, highlight specific results like “Increased sales by 20%.”

## Tips

- ✅ **List relevant awards or honors you have received, ONLY those that are related to your field**
- ✅ **Include the name of the award, the organization that gave it, and the date you received it**
- ✅ **Include only official awards accepted worldwide**
- ❌ **Don't include awards or honors that are not relevant or significant to your field**
