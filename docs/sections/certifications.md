# How to List Certifications & Trainings on Your Resume

## Why Certifications & Trainings Matter

Certifications and trainings can be game-changers on your resume, especially if they’re directly relevant to the job. They validate your skills, show your commitment to professional growth, and can often help you stand out in a crowded field of applicants. For roles requiring specific qualifications, these certifications can be the difference between getting an interview or getting passed over.

## Where to List Certifications & Trainings

### 1. **Dedicated Section**

The most common approach is to create a separate section titled “Certifications” or “Certifications & Training.” Place this section below your education or experience sections. This method works well if you have multiple certifications to showcase.

### 2. **Resume Summary**

If a certification is crucial for the job, mention it in your resume summary. This draws immediate attention to it, making it clear that you have the key qualifications right from the start.

### 3. **Contact Information**

For roles that require a specific certification (like PMP, CPA, or RN), you can list the certification next to your name in the contact section. This is especially effective if the job posting emphasizes the need for that certification.

### 4. **Education Section**

If you obtained your certifications as part of your formal education, or if the certification is not the main focus but still relevant, include it in your education section.

## How to Format Certifications & Trainings

- **Full Certification Title**: Avoid abbreviations unless they are industry-standard or mentioned in the job posting.
- **Issuing Organization**: Include the full name of the certifying body.
- **Date Earned/Expected**: List the date you obtained the certification, or if it’s in progress, note the expected completion date.
- **Expiration Date (if applicable)**: Mention the expiration date if the certification needs renewal.
- **Details (optional)**: If relevant, add a short description of the skills or knowledge gained.

### Example:

**Certifications**

- AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Professional, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Earned: March 2023
- Certified Project Management Professional (PMP), Project Management Institute (PMI), Earned: June 2021, Expires: June 2024

## General guidelines

- **Relevance is Key**: Only include certifications that are relevant to the job you’re applying for.
- **Order Matters**: List your certifications in reverse-chronological order, with the most recent first.
- **Be Honest**: Don’t list certifications that are expired or certifications you haven’t fully completed.
- ✅ **List any relevant certificates or licenses you have obtained**
- ✅ **Include the name of the certificate or license, the institution or organization that issued it, and the date it was obtained**
- ✅ **Hyperlink if it's a digital certificate**
- ❌ **Don't include irrelevant or outdated certificates that are not relevant to the job you are applying for**
- ❌ **Don't make up or exaggerate certificates or licenses that you do not actually have**
- ❌ **Don't provide incomplete or inaccurate information about your certificates or licenses, as this can be easily verified and can harm your credibility as a candidate**
