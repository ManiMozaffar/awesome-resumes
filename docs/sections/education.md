# How to Write the Education Section on Your Resume

## Keep It Relevant

Your education section should reflect what’s most relevant to the job you’re applying for. If you’ve got a degree, no need to mention your high school unless it’s the highest level of education you’ve completed. For those in specialized fields, like tech or healthcare, highlight specific coursework, projects, or certifications that match the job requirements.

## Structure It Clearly

Start with your highest degree and work backward. Include the degree type, major, institution name, location, and graduation date (or expected date if you’re still studying). If you have multiple degrees, list them separately. For ongoing education, use phrases like “In progress” or “Expected completion” with the month and year.

### Example:

**Bachelor of Science in Computer Science**
University of XYZ, City, State  
Graduated: May 2023  
GPA: 3.8/4.0, Dean’s List, Relevant Coursework: Data Structures, AI, Algorithms

## Highlight Achievements and Honors

Don’t just list your degree—showcase what you achieved. If you graduated with honors, were on the Dean’s List, or received any scholarships, include that. Quantifiable achievements can add extra weight, especially if you lack work experience.

## Tailor It to the Job

Just like with the rest of your resume, tailor the education section to each job. If you’re applying for a role that requires specific knowledge or skills, highlight relevant coursework or projects. This is particularly useful for recent grads or those with limited work experience. e.x if PHD is required, it even worth mentioning it on your summary!

## Don’t Fudge the Details

Be 100% honest about your education. It’s easy for employers to verify your credentials, and any discrepancies can quickly ruin your chances. If you didn’t finish a degree, list the credits or courses you completed without explaining why you didn’t finish—that’s a conversation for the interview, not the resume.

## Placement on the Resume

If you’re fresh out of school or your education is a big part of what qualifies you for the job, put it at the top of your resume. For those with more experience, place it below your work history.

## General guidelines:

- ✅ List your most recent degree or certification first
- ✅ Include the name of the institution, degree/certification, major/field of study, and graduation date
- ✅ If you have a strong academic record, include your GPA
- ❌ Avoid mentioning high school education unless it's your highest level of education
