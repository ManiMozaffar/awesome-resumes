# How to List Languages on Your Resume

## Why It Matters

Listing language skills on your resume can give you a competitive edge, especially in today’s global job market. However, it’s important to be strategic about how you list them to ensure they add value to your application.

## How to List Languages

1.  **Use Standard Proficiency Levels**: Stick to recognized proficiency levels:

    - **Elementary proficiency**
    - **Limited working proficiency**
    - **Professional working proficiency**
    - **Full professional proficiency**
    - **Native or bilingual proficiency**

    Avoid using visual ratings like stars or bars, as these can be misleading and may not be ATS-friendly.

2.  **Relevance is Key**: Only include languages that are relevant to the job or company. If the job doesn’t require a specific language and you’re not proficient, it’s best to leave it off your resume.

3.  **Where to Place It**: Create a dedicated "Languages" section on your resume. Place it after the main sections like Work Experience, Education, and Skills. If language proficiency is a key requirement for the job, consider mentioning it in your summary or work experience as well.

4.  **Backup Your Claims**: If you have certifications or test scores that validate your language proficiency, include them. For example, you can hyperlink to your TOEFL or IELTS scores. BUT only do that, if it's a requirement for the job.

5.  **You are showcasing your writing skill by sending your resume!**: When writing a resume, you're already showcasing your English skills. Make sure your resume is well-written and free of grammatical errors to demonstrate your language proficiency.
