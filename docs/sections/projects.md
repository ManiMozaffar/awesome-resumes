## Learn how to write a good bullet points for your project section

[The most important part of writing a project section is to write a good bullet points. Make sure to read that section first, before jumping on this section!](../guidelines/structure.md/#bullet-points)

Including projects on your resume can be a game-changer, especially if you‚Äôre a recent grad, changing
careers, or have experience that isn‚Äôt fully captured in your job titles. Here‚Äôs how to do it right:

## Be Selective

List only the most relevant projects that showcase your skills and experience directly related to the job you‚Äôre applying for. Don‚Äôt clutter your resume with outdated or irrelevant projects that don‚Äôt highlight your current abilities.

## Provide Clear and Concise Descriptions

For each project, include:

- **Project Name**: Give your project a specific name or title.
- **Role**: What was your role? Were you a developer, manager, or analyst?
- **Purpose**: Briefly describe the goal or purpose of the project.
- **Technologies Used**: List the key tools, languages, or frameworks you utilized.
- **Results/Achievements**: Focus on what you accomplished. Did you improve performance, save costs, or complete the project ahead of schedule? Use quantifiable metrics where possible (e.g., ‚ÄúImproved load times by 20%‚Äù).

### Example:

**Website Optimization Project**  
_Backend Developer, Fintech Solutions_  
_Technologies Used: Python, PostgreSQL, Docker_
_Github URL: ..._

- Optimized database queries, reducing page load times by 30%.
- Implemented caching mechanisms that decreased server load by 15%.

## Tailor Your Projects to the Job

Each project should reinforce your suitability for the job you‚Äôre applying for. If a project doesn‚Äôt directly align with the job requirements, either omit it or move it to a less prominent place on your resume. Tailoring ensures that your projects help you stand out as a candidate.

## Where to Place Projects

Depending on their relevance, projects can be included in different sections of your resume:

- **Professional Experience**: If the project was part of your job, list it under your work experience.
- **Education**: Include academic projects here if you‚Äôre a recent grad.
- **Dedicated Projects Section**: If you have several impressive projects, create a separate section titled ‚ÄúKey Projects‚Äù or ‚ÄúSelected Projects.‚Äù

## General guidelines:

- ‚úÖ List your most relevant projects, ideally those that showcase your skills and expertise
- ‚úÖ Provide a brief description of each project, including its purpose, your role, and the technologies used
- ‚úÖ Focus on your contributions to the project and any notable achievements, such as meeting tight deadlines or exceeding project goals
