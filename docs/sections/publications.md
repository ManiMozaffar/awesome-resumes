# How to List Publications & Conferences on Your Resume

## Why Publications & Conferences Matter

Including publications and conferences on your resume is essential if you‚Äôre in a field where research, thought leadership, or subject matter expertise is valued. This is especially true in academia, scientific fields, and certain industries like tech and healthcare. They highlight your contributions to your field and showcase your ability to communicate knowledge effectively.

## Where to List Publications & Conferences

### 1. **Dedicated Section**

Create a separate section titled "Publications" or "Publications & Conferences." This section should be placed after your education or work experience. It‚Äôs important to highlight this section if you have multiple entries that are relevant to the job. If it's in this section, you can have multiple bullet points for each publication or conference, from your achievement.

### 2. **Within the Experience Section**

For a more integrated approach, include key publications and presentations directly within your work experience entries. This is particularly effective if the publication or conference is directly tied to a specific role you‚Äôve held.If it's in this section, you can have one or very few bullet point(s) for each publication or conference, from your achievement.

### 3. **In the Education Section**

If you‚Äôre a recent graduate or have academic publications, placing them under your education section can be appropriate. This is especially true if the publications are directly related to your academic work, like a thesis or dissertation. If it's in this section, you can have one or very few bullet point(s) for each publication or conference, from your achievement.
