# How to Handle References on Your Resume

## Should You Include References on Your Resume?

In most cases, **no**. It’s generally recommended not to include references directly on your resume. Including them can make your resume look outdated and take up valuable space that could be better used to highlight your skills and achievements. Instead, prepare a separate references list that you can provide if requested.

## When to Include References

There are a few situations where you might include references:

- **Requested by the Job Posting**: If the job description specifically asks for references, include them on a separate page.
- **Entry-Level or Career Change**: If you’re new to the job market or switching careers, references might help bridge the gap by showcasing your potential through trusted endorsements.

## Creating a Reference List

If you need to provide references, here’s how to do it:

- **Separate Document**: Create a dedicated “References” page that matches the style and formatting of your resume and cover letter.
- **Essential Details**: For each reference, include their full name, job title, company name, phone number, email address, and a brief description of how you know them (e.g., former manager, colleague).
- **Quality Over Quantity**: Three to five references are ideal. Choose people who can speak positively and knowledgeably about your work.

### Example Reference List:

**References**

**John Doe**  
Marketing Manager, ABC Corp.  
johndoe@abccorp.com | (123) 456-7890  
Former manager at XYZ Company

**Jane Smith**  
Project Lead, DEF Solutions  
janesmith@defsolutions.com | (987) 654-3210  
Collaborated on multiple projects

## Best Practices

- **Ask First**: Always get permission from your references before sharing their contact details.
- **Keep Them Updated**: Inform your references when you’re applying for a job and provide them with relevant details so they can be prepared.
- **Tailor Your References**: Choose references who are most relevant to the job you’re applying for. For example, if you’re applying for a management position, include someone who can speak to your leadership skills.

## Avoid These Mistakes

- **No “References Available Upon Request”**: This phrase is outdated and unnecessary. Employers assume you have references available.
- **Don’t Include Personal References**: Stick to professional references unless you’re specifically asked for a personal one.

By handling your references properly, you ensure that they support your candidacy without cluttering your resume or making it look old-fashioned.
